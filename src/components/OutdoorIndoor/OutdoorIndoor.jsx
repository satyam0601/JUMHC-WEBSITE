          the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain

          saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
          simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
          is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we 
          like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But
          in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
          of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
          and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matter
          to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater 
          pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
